## Running the game
In order to play this game you will need to run it in a terminal. Depending on your operating system you might need to make some minor adjustments. If you don't know how to navigate in a terminal I recommend asking Chat-GPT.

The game is available for download from the [release pages](https://github.com/kjosavik/Korz/releases).

### Linux
Make file executable: `chmod +x korz-Linux-X64`

Run: `./korz-Linux-X64`

### Windows
I was able to run it by double clicking the file in Windows.

If that doesn't work open PowerShell or cmd and navigate to the folder it's located in and run.

`.\Korz-Windows-X64.exe`

### Mac (Apple silicon)

You will most likely run into a security prompt telling you that the app cannot run because Apple can't verify the developer. Well I guess that's true, but you trust me right? After getting the prompt, head over to 'System Settings' > 'Privacy & Security', scroll down and click "Open Anyway". After trying to open it again you will be asked again if you want to open it.

If the application does not open, navigate to the folder and do the following:

Make file executable: `chmod +x korz-macOS-ARM64`

Run: `./korz-macOS-ARM64`

### Mac (Intel)
You will most likely run into a security prompt telling you that the app cannot run because Apple can't verify the developer. Well I guess that's true, but you trust me right? After getting the prompt, head over to 'System Settings' > 'Privacy & Security', scroll down and click "Open Anyway". After trying to open it again you will be asked again if you want to open it.

If the application does not open, navigate to the folder and do the following:
